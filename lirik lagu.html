                Oohh... Oohh
                Oh you, came in to this life<br>
                Brought up as an orphan child<br>
                Through a time of deep despair, O Muhammad!<br>
            </p>
            <p>    
                Your days at work began<br>
                As a fair and honest man<br>
                You showed just how much you cared<br>
            </p>    
                And one night in that cave<br>
                When the Archangel came<br>
                And your life in this world<br>
            <p>    
                Would never be the same<br>
                Rasool'Allah, Habib'Allah<br>
                Your light is always showing me the way<br>
            <P>    
                Rasool'Allah, Habib'Allah<br>
                I'm longing for the day I see your face<br>
                Oohh...<br>
                You brighten up my day<br>
                Oohh...<br>
                And in my heart you'll stay<br>
                Oohh...<br>
                With every breath I take<br>
                Oohh...<br>
                I'll never leave your way<br>
            <p>    
                Eyes that could light up any soul<br>
                You became the Chosen One<br>
                To proclaim the world of God, O Muhammad!<br>
                In the brightness of the Sun<br>
                Or the Stillness of the night<br>
                You would never ever stop<br>
            <p>    
                Being kind, giving hope<br>
                And serenity and love<br>
                To a divided world<br>
                That didn't have enough<br>
            <p>    
                Rasool'Allah, Habib'Allah<br>
                Your light is always showing me the way<br>
